approval process:
    1. It’s likely that you’re familiar with process automation in the form of workflow rules.
       Approvals take automation one step further,
       letting you specify a sequence of steps that are required to approve a record.

    2. An approval process automates how records are approved in Salesforce.
    
    3. An approval process specifies each step of approval, including from whom to request approval and what to do at each point of the process.
